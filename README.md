Working on the Dice TDD workshop


V1.1:

As a board game player,
So that I can play a game
I want to be able to roll a dice


V1.2:

As a board game player,
So that I know how many steps I should move
Rolling a dice should give me a number between 1 and 6


V1.3:

As a dice app developer,
So that I give players a good game experience
If it is not already random, I want the dice roll to be randomly picked


V1.4:

As a board game player,
So that I can play many types of games
I want to be able to roll any number of dice at the same time


V1.5:

As a board game player,
So that I can keep track of past and previous rolls
I want to record each dice roll


V1.6:

As a board game player,
So that I know what my score is after I have rolled several dice
I want to be able to get my current score
